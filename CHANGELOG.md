# 4.3.0

Features:

- Introduced possibility to safely remove entities from the engine.
  Now `Engine.removeEntity` takes a boolean value as a second argument "safe",
  which indicates whether the entity should be removed safely or not.

  If safe argument value is `true` then the entity will be removed after the Engine update cycle is
  iteration is finished, meaning that the entity will be removed after all systems have been updated.

  Safely removed entities won't be discoverable by getEntityById method, but they will be still accessible
  in the queries (and remaining systems updates).

  This behavior will become default in the next major release.

# 4.2.0

Features:

- Now you can request for system removal when it's no longer needed. Check `requestRemoval`.

# 4.1.0

Fixes:

- \[Breaking Change\] Arguments order of `pick` by id API aligned with other APIs.
- `isLinkedComponent` now returns false for undefined values, instead of throwing an Error.

# 4.0.5

Features:

- The following APIs got an additional optional id parameter to make working with Linked Components easier: `has`
  , `hasComponent`, `get`.

# 4.0.4

Fixes:

- `id` of `LinkedComponent` is not readonly anymore.

# 4.0.3

Features:

- Linked components now have an optional id, and can be picked with `pick` by id.

Fixes:

- Fixed usage sample for LinkedComponents

# 4.0.2

Fixes:

- If IterativeSystem was removed from the engine and added again later, no iteration took place.

# 4.0.1

Fixes:

- ReactionSystem now exported through index.ts

# 4.0.0

Features:

- Added a new convenient API for working with linked components:
  - Method `withdraw` removes the first LinkedComponent component of the provided type or existing standard component
  - Method `pick` removes provided LinkedComponent component instance or existing standard component
  - Method `iterate` iterates over instances of LinkedComponent and performs the `action` over each. Works for standard
    components (action will be called for a single instance in this case).
  - Method `find` searches a component instance of the specified class. Works for standard components (predicate will be
    called for a single instance in this case).
  - Method `getAll` returns a generator that can be used for iteration over all instances of specific type components.
  - Method `lengthOf` returns the number of existing components of the specified class.

Breaking changes:

- Signals `onComponentAdded`, `onComponentRemoved` now will be triggered for every LinkedComponent.
- Adding a linked component with `add` or `addComponent` will remove all existing linked components of the same type.
  Linked components will be replaced even if the passed component already exists in the Entity.

# 3.0.1

Fixes:

- `EntitySnapshot.current` now is writable.
- Added inline documentation to `EntitySnapshot.previous`.

# 3.0.0

Features:

- Added shared config entity, that is accessible across all systems added to `Engine`
- Added possibility to retrieve `Entity` from `Engine` by id

Breaking changes:

- Parameter `engine` was removed from `onAddedToEngine` and `onRemovedFromEngine` methods in the systems. Use `this.engine` instead.
- `EntitySnapshot` was reimplemented. It has distinguished fields `EntitySnapshot.current and `EntitySnapshot.previous`,
  which reflects current and previous Entity states accordingly.
- `Entity.components` now represented as a `Record` instead of the `Map`

Improvements:

- Typed-signals was replaced with the built-in light-weight implementation.
- `EntitySnapshot` won't be created if there are no change listeners.

Fixes:

- `Entity.copyFrom` now copies tags.
- `EntitySnapshot` now works properly with the tags. Previously, the difference between the previous state and the
  current state did not show changes in the tags.
- `EntitySnapshot` now works properly with the resolveClass.

# 2.2.0

Features:

- Add linked components Fixed:
- Documentation readability

# 2.1.0

Features:

- Add possibility to set any type as the message type for subscription

# 2.0.2

# 2.0.0
- Added tags support
- Added messaging channel for system->engine->user
- Fixed EntitySnapshot behavior
- Added `engine` getter in the System
- Added support of initialization ReactionSystem and IterativeSystem with QueryPredicate and QueryBuilder
- Query got possibility to check whether entity is in it, via `has` method
- Documentation completely rewritten

# 1.4.1

- Removed redundant `updateEntity` from `ReactionSystem`

# 1.4.0

- Added `ReactionSystem`
- Documentation updated

# 1.3.0

- Fixed critical issue with updating of a `Query`. Queries whose predicates were a set of conditions that went beyond the capabilities of QueryBuilder could incorrectly evaluate the presence state for Entity after removing or adding components.   

# 1.2.7

- Fixed wrong type inference for `Entity#hasAll` and `Entity#hasAny`
- Added several utility methods for `Query`

# 1.2.6

- Added `first`, `last` and `length` getter for queries

# 1.2.5

- Added feature of invalidation entity and queries
- Fixed disconnecting of entities from engine

# 1.2.4

- Switched to commonjs modules

# 1.2.3

- Reverted `IterativeSystem#entities` remove
- Added `IterativeSystem#prepare` protected method, which will be invoked after adding iterative system to engine

# 1.2.2

- Added Entity#hasAny, Entity#hasAll methods
- Fixed throwing an error with passing invalid value to param `component` of `Entity#add` method
- Removed redundant `entities` getter from `IterativeSystem`

# 1.2.1

- Fixed bug with disconnecting from Entity events after remove from Engine. 
- Added utility methods for clearing `Engine`. 
  - `Engine#clear()`
  - `Engine#removeAllSystems()`
  - `Engine#removeAllQueries()`
  - `Engine#removeAllEntities()`

# 1.2.0
- Changed logic of resolving of component identifier. Changes could affect resolving of inherited components. Now inherited components will not be resolved as its ancestors.
- Added parameter for Entity#add "resolveClass" - which specifies how could be resolved component.
- Updated documentation

# 1.1.2
- Added Query#isEmpty property

# 1.1.1

- Switched library target to ES5

# 1.0.5
- Updated documentation for every core type
- Added guard that stops updating process for IterativeSystem, if it was removed engine
